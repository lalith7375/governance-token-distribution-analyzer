- ✅ Create configuration system for API endpoints and contract addresses
- ✅ Establish error handling and logging framework

### Week 2: Core Analysis Implementation ✅
- ✅ Build token distribution calculation functions (concentration ratios, Gini coefficients)
- ✅ Implement governance participation tracking across target protocols
- ✅ Create basic data visualization capabilities using matplotlib or plotly
- ✅ Develop initial comparative analysis framework

### Week 3: MVP Completion and Documentation ✅
- ✅ Integrate all components into cohesive application
- ✅ Generate sample outputs and validate accuracy against known data points
- ✅ Write comprehensive documentation including setup instructions and methodology explanations
- ✅ Create initial findings report highlighting key insights from cross-protocol analysis

## Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis Capabilities (Weeks 4-6) ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Expand analytical depth and add more sophisticated governance insights

**Status:** ✅ Complete. All advanced features implemented and tested with 100% integration test success rate.

### Advanced Metrics Implementation ✅
- ✅ Historical trend analysis showing how token distribution changes over time
- ✅ Voting block analysis identifying coordinated governance participation
- ✅ Proposal outcome prediction based on token holder composition
- ✅ Delegation pattern analysis for protocols supporting vote delegation

### Protocol Expansion 🔄 (DEFERRED)
- 🔄 Add MakerDAO (MKR) for governance token with different economic model
- 🔄 Include Yearn Finance (YFI) representing community-driven governance evolution
- 🔄 Integrate Balancer (BAL) showing liquidity mining governance distribution

**Note:** Protocol expansion is deferred until after the MVP is fully validated and deployed. The current focus is on ensuring a robust, production-ready application for Compound, Uniswap, and Aave.

### Data Quality Enhancements ✅
