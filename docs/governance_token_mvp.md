# Governance Token Distribution Analysis Tool - MVP Target

## Core Value Proposition
Create a functional Python tool that demonstrates practical understanding of blockchain governance by analyzing and comparing token distribution patterns across major DeFi protocols, providing actionable insights that crypto companies would value.

## MVP Scope Definition

### Primary Protocols for Analysis
- **Compound (COMP)**: Lending protocol with liquidity mining distribution
- **Uniswap (UNI)**: DEX with airdrop and liquidity provider rewards
- **Aave (AAVE)**: Lending protocol with staking and governance features

### Essential Data Points to Collect
- Total token supply and circulating supply
- Top holder addresses and their percentage ownership
- Governance proposal participation rates
- Voting power concentration (Gini coefficient)
- Token distribution timeline and major distribution events

### Core Analysis Features
- **Distribution Concentration Analysis**: Calculate and visualize how concentrated token ownership is across each protocol
- **Governance Participation Metrics**: Track what percentage of token holders actually participate in governance votes
- **Cross-Protocol Comparison**: Generate side-by-side comparisons showing how different distribution methods affect governance outcomes

### Minimum Technical Requirements
- Python scripts that successfully pull data from public APIs (Etherscan, The Graph, protocol-specific APIs)
- Data processing functions that calculate meaningful metrics without requiring external dependencies beyond standard data science libraries
- Output generation that produces both numerical results and basic visualizations
- Clean, documented code that another developer could run and understand

### Success Criteria for MVP
- Successfully retrieves live data from all three target protocols
- Produces accurate calculations of token concentration and participation rates
- Generates at least one meaningful insight about how distribution affects governance (e.g., "Protocols with broader token distribution show 15% higher participation rates")
- Includes comprehensive README with setup instructions and sample outputs
- Code runs without errors on a fresh Python environment with standard libraries

### Key Deliverables
- Working Python application with modular structure
- Sample data outputs demonstrating successful analysis
- Documentation explaining methodology and findings
- Basic visualizations showing distribution patterns
- Comparative analysis report highlighting key differences between protocols

## Strategic Impact
This MVP demonstrates three crucial capabilities that crypto companies value: technical competency in blockchain data analysis, understanding of governance mechanisms across different protocols, and ability to extract actionable insights from complex data. The cross-protocol comparison element particularly showcases strategic thinking about governance design rather than simple technical execution.
