## Features

- **Actionable Insights**: Gain insights into governance health and token distribution.
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Analyze various DeFi protocols including Compound, Uniswap, and Aave.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize key metrics through graphs and charts.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple commands for quick analysis.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate reports that summarize findings.

## Installation

To get started with the Governance Token Distribution Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lalith7375/governance-token-distribution-analyzer.git
   cd governance-token-distribution-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/lalith7375/governance-token-distribution-analyzer/releases) to download the latest version. Execute the file to start using the analyzer.

## Usage

To analyze governance token distribution, simply run the following command:

```bash
python analyzer.py --protocol <protocol_name>
```

Replace `<protocol_name>` with one of the supported protocols: `compound`, `uniswap`, or `aave`.

### Example

```bash
python analyzer.py --protocol uniswap
```

This command will generate a report specific to Uniswap, detailing its governance health and token distribution metrics.

## Supported Protocols

The Governance Token Distribution Analyzer currently supports the following DeFi protocols:

- **Compound**: A protocol for algorithmic, efficient money markets on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Uniswap**: A decentralized trading protocol that allows users to swap various tokens directly.
- **Aave**: A decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow a variety of cryptocurrencies.

## Key Metrics

The analyzer focuses on several key metrics to assess governance health and tokenomics:

- **Voting Power**: Measures the influence of token holders in governance decisions.
- **Token Distribution**: Analyzes how tokens are distributed among users and stakeholders.
- **Participation Rate**: Evaluates how actively token holders engage in governance activities.
- **Liquidity Metrics**: Assesses the liquidity of tokens within the protocol.
- **Transaction Volume**: Analyzes the volume of transactions to understand user engagement.

## Data Visualization

The tool generates various visualizations to help interpret the data. You can view graphs that depict:

- Token distribution across different holders.
- Historical voting power trends.
- Participation rates over time.
