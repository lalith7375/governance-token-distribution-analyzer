## Success Metrics

The project's success can be measured by:

1. **Accuracy**: Correct calculation of concentration indices (Gini coefficient, Herfindahl index)
2. **Simulation**: Realistic simulation of different distribution patterns
3. **Visualization**: Proper visualization of distribution trends
4. **Reports**: Generation of comprehensive and insightful reports
5. **Usability**: Intuitive CLI interface with clear documentation
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (aim for >90%)
7. **Integration**: Seamless integration between components
8. **Governance Analysis**: Accurate identification of voting blocks and patterns

## Development Notes

### Project Structure
- The project follows a modern Python package structure with code in the `src/` directory
- The main package is located at `src/governance_token_analyzer/`

### Running Tests
- Set your PYTHONPATH to include the src directory:
  ```
  export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src
  ```
- Run pytest from the project root:
  ```
  pytest src/tests
  ```
- Or with more verbose output:
  ```
  pytest -v src/tests
  ```

### Import Strategy
- All imports in the project should reference the package from the src directory
- Example: `from governance_token_analyzer.core import metrics`
