## Current Test Coverage
- Overall test coverage: ~92% (96/104 tests passing)
- Integration tests: 100% (41/41 tests passing)
- Unit tests: ~87% (55/63 tests passing)

## Deployment Status

- Ready for initial deployment

## Success Metrics

The project's success can be measured by:

1. **Accuracy**: Correct calculation of concentration indices (Gini coefficient, Herfindahl index)
2. **Live Data**: Successfully fetching and analyzing live blockchain data
3. **Fallback Logic**: Gracefully handling missing API keys or provider outages
4. **Visualization**: Proper visualization of distribution trends
5. **Reports**: Generation of comprehensive and insightful reports
6. **Usability**: Intuitive CLI interface with clear documentation
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (aim for >90%)
8. **Integration**: Seamless integration between components
9. **Governance Analysis**: Accurate identification of voting blocks and patterns

## Development Notes

### Project Structure
- The project follows a modern Python package structure with code in the `src/` directory
- The main package is located at `src/governance_token_analyzer/`

### Running Tests
- Set your PYTHONPATH to include the src directory:
  ```
  export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src
  ```
- Run pytest from the project root:
  ```
  pytest src/tests
  ```
- Or with more verbose output:
  ```
  pytest -v src/tests
  ```

### Import Strategy
- All imports in the project should reference the package from the src directory
- Example: `from governance_token_analyzer.core import metrics`
